Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal is for the user to determine their type of thinking based on their mentality and perspective. The code will ask a short series of questions to calculate the percentage of realism and idealism based on the choice they select.

 
Known Issues:
A known issue of the goal is its simplicity. It is not realistically accurate enough to legitimately diagnose the user with a condition.
